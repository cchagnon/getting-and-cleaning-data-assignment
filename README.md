#### Overview

This repository contains one R script, run\_analysis.R, that does the following:

1.  Merges two datasets (see description below) into one.
2.  From the merged dataset, extracts only the mean and standard deviation columns for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive labels and variable names to make the dataset understandable.
4.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject in the above dataset.

See [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) for further detail on run\_analysis.R
